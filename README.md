This app is hosted on GitHub Pages: [Test Link](https://georgejohnsonoff-business.github.io/spendwiselygeorge/)

**Important Note for GitHub Pages:**
-   **Static Hosting Only:** The Python backend (`server.py`) and Fold CLI do **not run** on GitHub Pages.
-   **Features Working:**
    -   Basic UI Structure.
    -   Manual Expense Adding (via Google Script).
-   **Features NOT Working:**
    -   **Bank Sync** (Requires backend server).
    -   **Mutual Fund Portfolio** (Currently requires backend proxy).
    -   **Settings Configuration** (Requires local file writing).

To enable full features, you must run the server locally or on a cloud platform like Render/Railway.
